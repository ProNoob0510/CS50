// If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Average Energy = 0.65906
Average Valence = 0.484443
Average Danceabilty = 0.71646

I would characterise their audio aura as purple.

// Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
It's not very accurate as I did not base the measurements using any set parameters, I just guesstimated the values. I would propose that there be thresholds for the average energy, valence and danceability for each aura to characterize a listener better. These thresholds can be determined by using focus groups.
